## Key Principles

- PEP 8 Compliance: Adhere to PEP 8 guidelines for code style, with Ruff as the primary linter and formatter.
- Elegance and Readability: Strive for elegant and Pythonic code that is easy to understand and maintain.
- Zen of Python: Keep the Zen of Python in mind when making design decisions.
- Avoid inheritance (prefer composition).
- Name functions and variables in such a way that you don't need comments to explain the code.
- Python folder and filenames should all be snake_cased regardless of what they contain.
- Capitalize comments, use proper grammar and punctuation, and no cursing.
- Prioritize new features in Python 3.9+.
- All Python dependencies **must be installed, synchronized, and locked** using `uv`.
- Never use `pip`, `pip-tools`, or `poetry` directly for dependency management.
- Write unit tests using pytest.
